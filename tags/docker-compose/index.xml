      <description>Recently at work, we have been discussing how to perform integration tests on dotnet core services. From previous experience, integration testing can be quite a messy process especially when performing reads and writes to a database. So, how do we test that our service can communicate with outside resources i.e. (databases, etc), without giving false failures and maintain consistent results? I&amp;rsquo;m sure that most of you have guessed by now we are going to use docker to create isolated integration tests.</description>
